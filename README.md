# MoneyBox android technical test

My take on this test involved a lot of RxJava2 / RxAndroid2 (for network requests and some data persistance), Singleton design pattern and ButterKnife for dependency injection.

It performs every objective the technical test has asked and in some cases goes above and beyond, i.e. logs user out on bearer token expiring. 

No necessary steps are required to run the app, just build in Android studio as per usual for any online examples.
